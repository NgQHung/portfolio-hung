            Hi, I am Hung Nguyen Quang, 23 years old. I am currently a student of Unicorn
            University, I am very confident in my knowledge of Software Development.
            <br />
            Although I have no formal work experience in the IT field, I have been involved in
            several personal projects recently that have allowed me to develop my skills and gain
            practical knowledge of the field. During this work, I focused on website development,
            mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and React. I believe these are valuable
            foundations that can help me understand and well meet the needs of your company`s
            customers.
            <br />I am open to entry-level opportunities, internships, or projects where I can apply
            my skills and continue to grow as an IT professional. I am confident that my passion,
            determination, and hands-on experience make me a valuable asset to any team.
        </p>

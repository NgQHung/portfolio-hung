                Hi, I am Hung Nguyen Quang, 23 years old. I am currently a student of Unicorn
                University, I am very confident in my knowledge of Software Development.
                <br />
                Although I have no formal work experience in the IT field, I have been involved in
                several personal projects recently that have allowed me to develop my skills and
                gain practical knowledge of the field. During this work, I focused on website
                development, mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and React. I believe
                these are valuable foundations that can help me understand and well meet the needs
                of your company`s customers.
                <br />I am open to entry-level opportunities, internships, or projects where I can
                apply my skills and continue to grow as an IT professional. I am confident that my
                passion, determination, and hands-on experience make me a valuable asset to any
                team.
            </p>
